# Logistic model and its validation
*Application of Statistical Methods for the Validation of Predictive Diagnostic Indices: The Case of COVID Hospitalizations*

I completed my Bachelor's degree during the COVID pandemic, so for my thesis I decided to analyze hospitalization data from a local city hospital, with the aim of identifying a model capable of predicting mortality risk for different types of patients.

Using R, I validated several research studies conducted worldwide to understand which model performed best. I employed logistic regression (GLM) and ROC curves, using the appropriate R packages.

Included files:

1) Excel database used for the calculations, containing the cleaned and organized data to facilitate processing in R.
2) R scripts with the programming work, split across two files for simplicity.
3) PDF of the thesis in italian, which includes the obtained results.
